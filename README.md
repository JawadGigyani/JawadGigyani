## Hello, I am Muhammad Jawad  
### AI Engineer | Agentic & Multi-Agent Systems | LLMs | RAG

I am an AI Engineer and Computer Science graduate with a focus on **applied generative AI and language model experimentation**. My work lies at the intersection of **agentic workflows, multi-agent systems, and practical AI system design**, with an emphasis on building solutions that operate under real-world constraints.

## About Me
- Experienced in **LLM-based experimentation** and building **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines to improve grounding and response quality  
- Strong interest in **agentic and multi-agent systems**, including task decomposition, tool-augmented reasoning, and workflow orchestration  
- Engineering mindset with exposure to **backend APIs and modular AI pipelines**, connecting AI models with practical applications  

## Technical Skills
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, SQL, Django, FastAPI, Pydantic  
- **AI & Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn  
- **Generative AI:** LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, Unsloth  
- **Techniques & Methodologies:** RAG, Agentic Workflows, PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA), Schema-Driven Prompting, Differential Privacy  
- **Databases & Vector Stores:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, FAISS, ChromaDB, QDrant  
- **Tools & Cloud:** LaTeX, Docker, Git/GitHub, DigitalOcean

## Community & Learning
- Served as [Section Leader](https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/CFED12FA8B287A01666B6EC7BCC0552F3296D7B7D8CEB4E0C81F8D18D398C862OURVQnpyM3lBTVVSUE5QcXdwOFE3aVEwc1F5MW1xNTZQeUtKdFlNdDlVWmltcGpW)
 at **Stanford University’s Code in Place**, supporting learners in Python and computational thinking  
- Actively learning through experimentation, reading, and building, with a long-term goal of contributing to **scalable and reliable AI systems**
